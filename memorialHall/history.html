      <p>When Sir John Brunner set up what is now known as ICI, he needed to import workers to run the business for him.He built houses in Barnton to accommodate the workers and their families.He also provided a school in Lydyett Lane for their children.</p>

<p> He opened the school in 1895 and in 1898 gave it to the people of Barnton by way of a Trust. This Trust required that should the school be no longer required it should become a village hall. The Parish Council were charged with setting up the Trust management. The Parish Council were also nominated as Guardian Trustees and they were charged with putting a management committee in place.</p> 

<p>In 1908 the Education Act made schooling free. As a result the then Cheshire County Council bought the school from the Trustees for £1.00 and became totally responsible for its upkeep. The school remained in use until 1959 when the now secondary education functions were transferred to the purpose-built school in Townfield Lane. As a result of this, Cheshire County Council transferred the school back to the Village under the terms of the Trust, with the Parish Council once again becoming Guardian Trustees responsible for setting up the management committee.</p>

<p>Since 1947 a group of people known as Friends of the Memorial Hall had been trying to set up a Memorial Hall in the Village in remembrance of those who gave their lives in the war. In 1951, the Parish Council bought the Town Field with a view to putting the Memorial Hall on it. The Friends of the Memorial Hall continued to raise money for the Hall over the years to 1964. The cost of building the Hall was always too much for their finances, so when the school became vacant in 1959, they worked with the Parish Council to convert the school. The result of this collaboration is that the Parish Council took out a loan (~£10,000) and this together with the funds from the Friends of the Memorial Hall (~£4,000) allowed the Parish Council to convert the School into a Village Hall. This conversion included upgrading the toilets and adding a small extension to the main hall.</p>

<p>In 1964 this work was complete and the Memorial Hall became a registered charity (Charity No. 520009).</p>

<p>By 2003, the Hall was really coming to the end of its useful life. Its use was down (around 9 hours a week), maintenance costs were high and the Primary Care Trust who used two rooms as a baby clinic wanted new premises and had given notice that they would be leaving. The result of this would be a significantly reduced income for the hall which was untenable.</p>

<p>The Trustees felt that the best way forward for the village was to sell the hall and its land and to build a new one fit for the 21st Century. The Trustees worked very closely with the Parish Council and the Primary Care Trust and were able to buy land at the Town Field site, sell the hall (it was replaced by a new Primary Care Trust Drs Clinic, four houses and a Co-operative store), and to build a new hall at the Town Field. The new Hall opened on the 11th November 2005.</p>
