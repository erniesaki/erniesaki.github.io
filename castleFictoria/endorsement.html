      <h1>Castle fictoria Endorsement</h1>

<p>"Thank you for a wonderful honeymoon at Castle Fictoria. The staff cared for us and made our holiday unforgettable. The room was comfortable and a pleasure to make our week-long home. We'll definitely be coming back" - Mr & Mrs Jones, England</p>
<p>"Away from the distractions of the big city, our conference was the most productive and creative we've ever held. The venue had plenty of space for break-out sessions and the catering was excellent. We particularly appreciated the attention that went into making unusual and delicious dishes for those with special dietary requirements" - George Smith, managing director, Sell-U-Stuff Incorporated</p>
<p>"It's rare that we find such a great venue within walking distance of the nature trails we visit. We had planned to hire a car to travel further afield, but with the castle so well-located, we didn't need to travel any further than we could walk to see the most amazing wildlife." - Peter Ermintrude, group organiser, Bedhamford Bird Watchers Club.</p>
