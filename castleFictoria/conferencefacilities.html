      <h1>Conference Facilities</h1>

<p>Fictoria Castle welcomes many corporate clients throughout the year, and can host presentations with theatre-seating, round table discussions and awards dinners. We can arrange cinema screening facilities for your business presentations and multimedia launches.</p>
<image src=images/meeting2.jpg>
<p>We also have an extensive business centre, offering fast internet access, telephone and fax facilities as well as computer rental with all popular office software pre-installed. You can hire a portable computer for use in your room or can use our full-size machines in the business centre. We can organise telephone and video conferencing for you, and can provide most types of stationery.</p>
<p>Many of our clients are regular visitors. They value the tranquillity they can enjoy at Castle Fictoria, and the opportunity to focus entirely on their business needs for the duration of their stay, without outside distractions.</p>
<p>Some of our meeting rooms are mobile-phone-free zones. If you're here to concentrate on important business problems, we recommend you consider a booking in one of these zones to avoid any disturbance.</p>
<p>We can cater for groups of up to 200 people, with room sizes starting at ten people. You pay a price based on the number of delegates attending and the number of days you require the meeting room. Your guests are of course welcome to extend their stay, paying for their accommodation only outside the conference duration.</p>
